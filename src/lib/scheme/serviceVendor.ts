 * These services price a flat ₹/txn customer charge on a SchemeSlab. When the
 * slab is pinned to a provider that has an approved service rate card
 * (RailMdrRate, serviceKind BBPS|PAYOUT — managed in "MDR & minimum charges"),
 * this resolves that card to:
 *   - LOCK the vendor cost onto the slab (SchemeSlab.vendorCharge), so company
 *     revenue per txn = chargeValue − vendorCharge is auditable, and
 *   - ENFORCE that the customer charge is never below the rate's Minimum charge.
 *
 * When there is no matching card (no provider pinned, none configured, or a
 * non-FLAT rate that can't be compared to a flat charge) it returns
 * enforced:false with vendorCharge 0 so existing un-carded slabs keep working.
